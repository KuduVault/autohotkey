Install Instructions:
1. Double click/open the 'install.bat' file


Usage Instructions:

1. Type "td" anywhere and hit space or enter
2. Watch as it autocompletes with the current date in ISO 8601 format


Note: If it freezes/hangs up, simply continue pressing keys until the output finishes populating.
This is due to a bug with the way certain programs (such as W11 Notepad) handle key inputs.

If you need to actually type 'td' and have it not become the date, place your cursor in front of any other character and type 'td' in front of that, then delete the extra character (since the script only registers the hotstring if you follow it with a Space, Enter, or Quote key)

For example:
1) type: ''
2) click between the ''
3) type: td
4) delete the extra characters
